## Overview
* This document has done some EDA and Data Engineering things based on the given csv data set and finnally built some high performance models.
* Some of the most import steps are: 1 dealing with imbalanced dataset. 2 exploration on the feature 'date'. 3 some devices are removed and then put back to use at different time period. 4 oversampling should be done before or within cross validation?
## project background
* Company has a fleet of devices transmitting daily aggregated telemetry attributes.Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service  equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive  maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
